(i) What are the predictor variables?

(ii) What is the target variable? Is my target variable discrete or continuous?

(iii) Should I use classification or regression analysis?

(iv) How do I handle missing values in my dataset?

(v) Should I use normalization or standardization when bringing variables to the same scale?

(vi) Should I use Principal Component Analysis or not?

(vii) How do I tune hyperparameters in my model?

(viii) How do I evaluate my model to detect biases in the dataset?

(ix) Should I use ensemble methods where I train using different models then perform an ensemble average, e.g. using classifiers such as SVM, KNN, Logistic Regression, then average over 3 models?

(x) How do I select the final model?
